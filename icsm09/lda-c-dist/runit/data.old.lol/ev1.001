1997-01-01	2000-06-14  Chris Toshok  <toshok@helixcode.com>  	* e-tree-example-1.c (print_tree): new function, to generate 	postscript so i can test tree printing. 	(create_tree): add print button.  	* e-cell-tree.c (ect_print_height): implement function (in a 	broken way for the time being, heh). 	(ect_print): implement function to draw tree controls and offset 	the subcell's printing.  icons aren't printed yet, just lines. 	(ect_draw): remove old unnecessary comments.  only draw the 	horizontal line in specific instances (well, add a test so a lone 	root node doesn't get the horizontal line.) 	(e_cell_tree_class_init): add print/print_height methods.
