1997-01-02		* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.c (camel_mbox_summary_sync): 	Renamed from camel_mbox_summary_expunge. Takes a gboolean saying 	whether to expunge or just sync the mbox file. Change some 	g_errors to g_warning so we don't abort. Make the quick 	X-Evolution updating code lseek around correctly. Update the 	mbox mtime in the summary file even in the quick case.  	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-summary.h: make 	CAMEL_MESSAGE_FOLDER_NOXEV not conflict with 	CAMEL_MESSAGE_FOLDER_FLAGGED defined in camel-mime-message.h  	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (mbox_close): call 	camel_mbox_summary_sync to save flag state if not expunging. 	(mbox_expunge): Update for camel_mbox_summary_expunge rename.
