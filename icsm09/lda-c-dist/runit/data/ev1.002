1997-01-01		* e-msg-composer-attachment-bar.c (add_from_user): keep the 	GtkFileSelection around between calls so we start up in the same 	directory we ended up in last time around. (Also fixes a big 	memory leak in that the code was already keeping the 	GtkFileSelection around, it just wasn't remembering to reuse it.)
