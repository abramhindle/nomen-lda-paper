1997-01-02	2000-06-14  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@helixcode.com>  	* camel-folder.c (init): Updated: a separator is now a char* rather than 	a single char because IMAP can have a string for a directory separator. 	Also, since IMAP does not begin with a directory separator, there is a new 	argument (path_begins_with_sep) which decides if a directory should begin 	with a directory separator.  	* providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c (imap_create): Since, on connect, 	Camel tries to create INBOX (which already exists on every IMAP provider) 	we can return TRUE when the folder name is "INBOX".  	* providers/vee/camel-vee-folder.c (vee_init): Updated.  	* providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c (camel_imap_folder_new): Updated.  	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-store.c (get_folder): Updated.  	* providers/mbox/camel-mbox-folder.c (mbox_init): Updated.  	* providers/pop3/camel-pop3-folder.c (camel_pop3_folder_new): Updated.
