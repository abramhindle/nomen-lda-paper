- Incremental over previous work
- Simplistic, fragile technique for unsupervised learning
- Limited practical value
- Details and assumptions of the proposed approach not clearly described
- Various issues in evaluation design
- no clear criteria for success in the analysis of case-study findings

MINE
- mention marcus's low precision? 
- mention cleland's good precision but also how much more structured it was. 
- an actual algorithm like in REFSQ?
- re-read moved sections in discussion
- does case study flow? 

FSE
- how to use it?
- discussion confusiong
- what to make of evolution viz?

ICSE
- give clear criteria for success
- how is viz useful
X how improves on topic windows and cleland huang
X what exactly is a topic
X why both from same domain?
X why claim unsupervised?
X no external validation
X mailing lists - why, where?
- level of effort needed unclear
- implications not supported
- manual annot. easy?
X how was annotation done?
- only show best learners in figure? why, seems biased.
X construct validity
