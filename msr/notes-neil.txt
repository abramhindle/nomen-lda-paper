x Incremental over previous work
x Simplistic, fragile technique for unsupervised learning
x Limited practical value
x Details and assumptions of the proposed approach not clearly described
x Various issues in evaluation design
x no clear criteria for success in the analysis of case-study findings

* fixes
** MINE
*** TODO mention marcus's low precision? 
*** DONE mention cleland's good precision but also how much more structured it was. 
*** TODO an actual algorithm like in REFSQ?
*** TODO re-read moved sections in discussion
*** TODO does case study flow? 

** FSE
*** DONE how to use it?
*** DONE discussion confusiong
*** TODO what to make of evolution viz?
*** TODO What does it really mean that labeled frequencies change over time or differ between projects? Is this bad? Good? Do we need to do something about it?

** ICSE
*** DONE give clear criteria for success
*** TODO how is viz useful
*** DONE how improves on topic windows and cleland huang
*** DONE what exactly is a topic
*** DONE  why both from same domain?
*** DONE  why claim unsupervised?
*** DONE  no external validation
*** DONE  mailing lists - why, where?
*** DONE  level of effort needed unclear
*** TODO implications not supported
*** DONE  manual annot. easy?
*** DONE  how was annotation done?
*** TODO only show best learners in figure? why, seems biased.
*** DONE  construct validity
