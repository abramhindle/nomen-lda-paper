Makefile.mulan  runs the mulan infrastructure to run
  cross validation across mysql and maxdb with mulan. Not sure how
  to interpret the results but a latex table is created.
  - MulanParser.pm
  - mulan-parser.pl
  - LatexTable.pm
  - Makefile.mulan
  - Makefile - make mulan
In order to generate even better visualizations we have to take
    commands from a XML file. So make_annotated_xml.py was created to
    do this. It reads in the period files and makes a new XML file in
    the output dir. This XML file has its annotations stripped and
    replaced which those suggested in quality_map.py

  - To plot these xml files
    file:/home/abez/projects/hiraldo_grok/hs/Xml_lda_render.hs
    was created. This takes in an xml file and uses annotation
    similarity or equality to draw boxes with our plotter.
    Since we multiple annotations the largest subset are chosen for
    equality of course. The problem is we need to make a legend on
    these colors :(

- Generate plots of non-Mulan data:
the python code does the stats on the annotations then it
  produces a boxplot xml file, this xml file is read by perl and then
  plotted by gnuplot into a boxplot graph (which can fixed later).
cd src/validate/
mkdir output
python count_annotations.py
perl boxplotit.pl output/*.xml #needs gnuplot
