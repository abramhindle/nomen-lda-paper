=Figure 1
* Show a stream of of changes

=Introduction
* Stakeholders want to know what the focus of the last iteration was
* Evidence of work done at Retrospective meetings
* Difference between developer opinion and developer commits


=Dictionary
* Message - in this a CVS Commit
* Word Distribution - count of words occuring in a message
* Topic - a word distribution that is common amongst messages
* Trend - a topic that re-occurs


=Developer Trends
* Trends
** Continuous or repeating topics
** Occur over multiple time windows

=LDA
* Latent Dirichlet Allocation
* Like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
* Like ICA/PCA
* Black box view:
** Input word distributions of messages, 
** Output topics consisting of a word distribution and related messages



=Topic Clustering 
* Need to track continuous topics across 
* Similarity between topics
* Clusters of the transitive closure of topics with X\% similarity
** Fill flood along similarity, make subsets of everyone who X\% similar to any of their neighbors, make that a cluster

\igonecap{transitiveclosure}{Clustering topics (black dots) by Transitive Closure based on similarity (arcs)}


=Topic Similarity
* Given 2 topics
** if their top 10 words 
*** share X words (7 or more)
****  they are similar

=Observations
* Topics could be named
** Certain words indicate a focus on
*** Maintenance
*** Bug Fixing
*** Portability
*** Potential 'ilities

=Observations
* Powerlaw distribution of repeating topic counts
** Most occured once
** A few were repeated 
*** less than 10\% of topics reoccur

=Unfinished
* Total Topics versus Monthly Topics
* Clean up plots

=Future work
* Cluster Naming
* Associate trends with software taxonomies
** Extension, associate Trends or Topics with purpoes by using wordnet and Taxonomies of software quality as suggested by Ernst et al.
* Validation

=Conclusions
* Contributions
** Auto extract trends
*** Present trends
** Apply topic analysis on timewindows rather than the entire project
