These are Kappa values

Fleiss Kappa

      0.211635362      -0.078431373       0.054121959
We disagree on portability, functionality, usability, and have poor
agreement on reliability

We disagree on functionality  and have poor agreement on reliability and
usability.

We disagree on functionality and reliability and usability and none and
maintainability aren't great :|

We agree on portability and efficiency

One issue is that we have 2 ratings 1 or 0


Globally we have "slight" agreement :|

> > kappam.fleiss(mat)$value
[1] 0.105742
> > kappa2(mat)$value
[1] 0.1078387

The correlation coeffecient is similar 0.108

So our agreement is not really that strong across our tags.

Here's a summary, pos agree is positive agreement ( a positive tag )
pos disagree is we applied a tag and it wasn't applied by the other dude.
Neg agree is we didn't tag it together!

[1] "A_portability"
[1] "Pos Disagree:  378"
[1] "Pos Agree:  189"
[1] "Neg Agree:  73"
[1] "A_functionality"
[1] "Pos Disagree:  335"
[1] "Pos Agree:  111"
[1] "Neg Agree:  194"
[1] "A_reliability"
[1] "Pos Disagree:  289"
[1] "Pos Agree:  19"
[1] "Neg Agree:  332"
[1] "A_maintainability"
[1] "Pos Disagree:  213"
[1] "Pos Agree:  25"
[1] "Neg Agree:  402"
[1] "A_efficiency"
[1] "Pos Disagree:  127"
[1] "Pos Agree:  31"
[1] "Neg Agree:  482"
[1] "A_usability"
[1] "Pos Disagree:  150"
[1] "Pos Agree:  2"
[1] "Neg Agree:  488"
[1] "A_none"
[1] "Pos Disagree:  25"
[1] "Pos Agree:  1"
[1] "Neg Agree:  614"

In every case it seems our agreement is different. I checked the data it
seems to be the right stuff..

This in interrater.R in the master branch.

I split postgresql into 2 projects pgsqln pgsqla to allow for this.
