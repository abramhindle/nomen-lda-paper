@article{benestad09,
abstract = {Understanding, managing and reducing costs and risks inherent in change are key challenges of software maintenance and evolution, addressed in empirical studies with many different research approaches. Change-based studies analyze data that describes the individual changes made to software systems. This approach can be effective in order to discover cost and risk factors that are hidden at more aggregated levels. However, it is not trivial to derive appropriate measures of individual changes for specific measure- ment goals. The purpose of this review is to improve change-based studies by (1) summarizing how attributes of changes have been measured to reach specific study goals and (2) describing current achieve- ments and challenges, leading to a guide for future change-based studies. Thirty-four papers conformed to the inclusion criteria. Forty-three attributes of changes were identified, and classified according to a conceptual model developed for the purpose of this classification. The goal of each study was to either characterize the evolution process, to assess causal factors of cost and risk, or to predict costs and risks. Effective accumulation of knowledge across change-based studies requires precise definitions of attributes and measures of change. We recommend that new change-based studies base such definitions on the proposed conceptual model.},

@inproceedings{Cleland-Huang2006,
abstract = {This paper introduces an information retrieval based approach for automating the detection and classification of non-functional requirements (NFRs). Early detection of NFRs is useful because it enables system level constraints to be considered and incorporated into early architectural designs as opposed to being refactored in at a later time. Candidate NFRs can be detected in both structured and unstructured documents, including requirements specifications that contain scattered and non-categorized NFRs, and freeform documents such as meeting minutes, interview notes, and memos containing stakeholder comments documenting their NFR related needs. This paper describes the classification algorithm and then evaluates its effectiveness in an experiment based on fifteen requirements specifications developed as term projects by MS students at DePaul University. An additional case study is also described in which the approach is used to classifying NFRs from a large free form requirements document obtained from Siemens Logistics and Automotive Organization},
