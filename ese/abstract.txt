Software repositories provide a deluge of software artifacts to
analyze. Researchers have attempted to summarize, categorize, and
relate these artifacts by using semi-unsupervised machine-learning
algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), used for
concept and topic analysis to suggest candidate word-lists or topics
that describe and relate software artifacts.  However, these
word-lists and topics are difficult to interpret in the absence of
meaningful summary labels.  Current topic modeling techniques assume
manual labelling and do not use domain-specific knowledge to improve,
contextualize, or describe results for the developers.  We propose a
solution: automated labelled topic extraction.  Topics are extracted
using LDA from commit-log comments recovered from source control
systems.  These topics are given labels from a generalizable
cross-project taxonomy, consisting of non-functional requirements. Our
approach was evaluated with experiments and case studies on three
large-scale Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) projects:
MySQL, PostgreSQL and MaxDB.  The case studies show that labelled
topic extraction can produce appropriate, context-sensitive labels
that are relevant to these projects, and provide fresh insight into
their evolving software development activities.
