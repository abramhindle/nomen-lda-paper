% \section{Word lists}

% Make a word list (a file) of related words and a label. Used wordnet
% similarity (unfiltered) and concepts from \cite{5072519}.

% \subsection{Observations}

% We ran it and we found that wordnet for correctness was too
% generic. We ran it on MaxDB 7.500 with the words: integrity, security,
% interoperability, testability, maintainability, traceability,
% accuracy, modifiability, understandability, availability, modularity,
% usability, correctness, performance, verifiability, efficiency,
% portability, flexibility, and reliability.

% We had 500 topics extracted.





\section{Exp1: Word Lists on MaxDb 7.500 commit log comments}

We extracted the commit log comments from MaxDB 7.500 and per month extracted 20 topics using LDA. There are 25 months, thus a total of topic 500 possible topics, but there were a couple of months with no commits.

Make a word list (a file) of related words and a label. We used
wordnet similarity (unfiltered) on concepts extracted from
\cite{5072519}.  The concepts used included: integrity, security,
interoperability, testability, maintainability, traceability,
accuracy, modifiability, understandability, availability, modularity,
usability, correctness, performance, verifiability, efficiency,
portability, flexibility, and reliability.

We determined if a word list was similar to a topic if they shared 1
or more words in common.

\subsection{Observations}

We ran it and we found that wordnet generated word lists for
\emph{correctness} were too large andgeneric. Results are listed below
in the results section

\subsection{Future attempts:}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Make better manual word lists
\item  Take that ISO standard that Neil used
\item  Take that ISO Architecture standard that ric mentioned
\item  Different similarity measure
\item  Utilize wordnet distance
\item  Utilize LDA to query its own model with single wordlists to get related documents
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

Here's the output of what I got:
\begin{verbatim}
Total Topics: 500
Total Named Topics: 281

\section{Exp2: Word Lists extracted from ISO9126 Taxonomy}

We extracted the commit log comments from MaxDB 7.500 and per month
extracted 20 topics using LDA. There are 25 months, thus a total of
topic 500 possible topics, but there were a couple of months with no
commits.

Make a word list (a file) of related words and a label.  These words
were extracted from the ISO9126 Taxonomy.  The main concepts used are:
functionality, reliability, maintainability, usability, efficiency,
and portability.

We determined if a word list was similar to a topic if they shared 1
or more words in common.

\subsection{Observations}

There are many more unnamed topics than before. Only reliability shows up very often.

The words that reliability finds are:
\begin{verbatim}
error 279
bug 25
fails 2
crash 14
failure 1
\end{verbatim}

Usability words
\begin{verbatim}
ui 16
user 8
default 4
gui 3
feature 2
\end{verbatim}

Portability words
\begin{verbatim}
documentation 5
migration 1
\end{verbatim}

Effeciency words
\begin{verbatim}
optimize 18
optimization 4
fast 3
slow 1
\end{verbatim}

And ``dependency'' for maintability

abstract={Recently, quality assurance concept has been developed increasingly to be included in many of our life existing fields; financial, industrial, trading, computing, etc. Software quality product attributes (SWQAs) have been created as a matter of applying the QA concept on the results of Web or desktop application development process, to fit the products with the organizational and global market standards and goals, and to provide it with a competitive advantage value. Web application or software product quality is composed of many attributes such as portability, usability, reliability, modularity. During the recent years, many researchers discussed and presented software attributes in their works which showed that till now there is a lack of consensus on the semantic of many of concepts and terminologies used in this field. Our work is focusing on studying software product quality attributes concepts and terminologies. We conduct several experiments to extract the main concepts for SWQAs. The results show that there is a number of concepts that are frequently used to describe these attributes. Summarizing and formalizing the semantic of the attributes into these concepts presents a common understanding and agreement on the semantic of SWQPAs which can be used by software engineers, researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders.},
